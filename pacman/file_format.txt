******save file instructions******
STEPS FILE:
0 UP
1 DOWN
2 LEFT
3 RIGHT
4 STAY
5 FRUIT WAKE UP
6 FRUIT SLEEP

Each round we save to the file a 4 char lenth string that contains the entities actions.
The order is pacman-->ghost1-->ghost2-->fruit.
After fruit spawns (5 in the file) we write the cords of the spawn (row, col).

RESULT FILE:
When pacman dies we write 'D' to the file and the frame which it happened in.
When pacman finishes a map we write 'W' to the file and the frame which it happened in.
