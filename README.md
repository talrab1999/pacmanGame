# Pac-Man Game
A console-based Pac-Man Game built in C++ as a project for learning and applying game programming concepts. This project recreates a classic Pac-Man experience with custom gameplay mechanics and AI for ghosts using pathfinding algorithms.

## Features
Classic Gameplay: Navigate through a maze, collect breadcrumbs, and avoid ghosts.

Multiple Game Modes: Choose between simple play or load/save modes.

Dynamic Ghost AI: Ghosts use an A* search algorithm to chase Pac-Man based on the current board state.

Customizable Difficulty & Speed: Adjust game speed and ghost difficulty to suit your play style.

Map Selection: Choose specific maps (screen files) or play through a sequence of maps.

User-Friendly Interface: Console-based display with clear instructions and real-time gameplay feedback.

## Controls
The game uses keyboard inputs to control Pac-Man. Here are the basic controls as displayed in-game:

Left: A or a

Right: D or d

Up: W or w

Down: X or x

Stay/Stop: S or s

Escape (Pause): ESC

# How to Play
Start a New Game: Choose your desired game mode and map selection from the menu.

Game Objective: Control Pac-Man to eat all the breadcrumbs on the map while avoiding the ghosts. Losing all your lives ends the game.

Ghost Behavior: Ghosts may chase you using an A* pathfinding algorithm. Their difficulty can be adjusted at the start of the game.

Map Transitions: In multi-map mode, after clearing a map, the game automatically transitions to the next available map.
